# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/icons/appbar_appicon.png
   - assets/icons/appbar_appicon_inverted.png
   - assets/icons/google_signin_button.png
   - assets/icons/google_sign_in_button.png
   - assets/images/appicon_rays.png
   - assets/icons/seperation_dot_icon.svg
   - assets/images/GIPHY_light.png
   - assets/images/GIPHY_dark.png
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Techna Sans Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/TechnaSansRegular.ttf
    - family: Diskopia
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Diskopia.ttf
    - family: Foo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Foo.ttf      
    - family: LostFish
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/LostFish.ttf
    - family: Georgia
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Georgia.ttf
    - family: OpenSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
